# Credits
This script is a reduction from a great proxy [mirrorrr](https://github.com/bslatkin/mirrorrr) created by [Brett Slatkin](http://www.onebigfluke.com). It is also based on [dropbprox](http://code.google.com/p/dropbprox) by [Paulo Jer√¥nimo] (http://paulojeronimo.com) for an older version of python.
